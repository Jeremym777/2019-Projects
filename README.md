These are the projects that I've created using R/Rstudio and Python. These various projects with descriptions include:
      
                                          -Storm Tracker (workout-1)-


• Analyzed and visualized various storm trajectories from 2010-2015 based on their locations and intensities.

• Reported various finding such as an increase number of storms over each year, and the duration of each one.

• Confirmed that the location of storms increased as well as their intensities.

                                      -Investment Modalities (workout-2)-


• Created and implemented an investment app within Shiny, that allows users to interacts with multiple
investment scenarios over a 50-year period.

• Analyzed the optimum expenditure needed that would yield the maximum return on investments.

• Established that U.S bonds would yield the maximum investment over a 50-year period.

                                   -Nobel Laureate Précis Compiler (workout-3)-


• Utilized web scraping techniques to extract and organize data of Nobel Laureates on Google Scholar.

• Analyzed and visualized frequently cited publications, commonly used words, and the most influential
publications within each Nobel Laureates field of study.

• Corroborated the inference that the Nobel Laureates shared similar publications that are influential to their
fields of study.

                             -San Francisco Food Safety Analysis (projects/project-1)-


• Utilized pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib to clean, visualize and manipulate data of various San Francisco
businesses

• Investigated that various businesses who had multiple inspections from 2016-2019, did not always improve
their scores.

• Corroborated the inference that San Francisco businesses with higher scores were mainly found within a
specific location and have a higher rate of success.


                                   -Spam/Ham Classification (projects/project-2)-
                               
• Employed a binary classification to create training and testing sets.

• Implemented a logistic regression model to distinguish between spam and ham emails based on selected features.

• Competed in a kaggle compition and achieved a model accuracy of 97.2%.

                                                
                                                    -Covid-19-

• Utilized pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib to preform EDA of records of Covid-19.

• Created a Linear Regression model that predicted the number of confirmed cases, death cases,recovery cases, and mortality rate after a 30 day period beginning as of May 10th.

• Reported that the there will be approx. more 2,843,315 confirmed cases on June 9th.
