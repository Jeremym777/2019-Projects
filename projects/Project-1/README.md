# Project-1

The purpose of this project was to explore the various inspection scores and violations of San Francisco businesses. In order to do this, I needed to analyze, clean, manipulate and visualize the data for each businees recorded within the csv file that was provided from 2016-2019. Into the project, I was able to find that many business experienced multiple inspections through a single year, where many business didn't improve their health inspection score and in some cases did significantly worse than their first inspection. Lastly, I was able to find the area of where the majority of inspections happen and as well as where these businesses were located.
