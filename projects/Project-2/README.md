# Project-2

The purpose of this project was to create a classification system for spam/ ham emails. To do this, I needed to first understand the data by performing EDA and using some feature engineering. Then after this was done, I created functions that would be able to locate certain features within emails that would be useful later on to train/test my data. Lastly, I created a logistic regression model in order to classify which emails were considered spam or ham and testing the overall accuracy of my model.
