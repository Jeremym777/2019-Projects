    "\n",
    "With this in mind, it is now your task to make the spam filter more accurate. In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set. To see your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kaggle limits you to four submissions per day**. This means you should start early so you have time if needed to refine your model. You will be able to see your accuracy on the entire set when submitting to Kaggle (the accuracy that will determine your score for question 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas for improving your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better (and/or more) words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use whatever method you prefer in order to create features, but **you are not allowed to import any external feature extraction libraries**. In addition, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models**. No random forests, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not provided any code to do this, so feel free to create as many cells as you need in order to tackle this task. However, answering questions 7, 8, and 9 should help guide you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *You should use the **validation data** to evaluate your model and get a better sense of how it will perform on the Kaggle evaluation.*\n",

    "Save your predictions in a 1-dimensional array called `test_predictions`. *Even if you are not submitting to Kaggle, please make sure you've saved your predictions to `test_predictions` as this is how your score for this question will be determined.*\n",

    "Remember that if you've performed transformations or featurization on the training data, you must also perform the same transformations on the test data in order to make predictions. For example, if you've created features for the words \"drug\" and \"money\" on the training data, you must also extract the same features in order to use scikit-learn's `.predict(...)` method.\n",
