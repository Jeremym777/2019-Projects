# Covid-19

For this project, I utalized everything that I learned from my class in order to analyze time series data of Covid-19. During this project, I was able to create time series time plots, and a linear regression model to predict the future number of cases for confirmed, deaths, recovery, and mortality rate after 30 days from May 10th.
