The purpose of this assignment was to analysis and visualize various storm patterns from 2010-2015. To accomplish this we needed to gather csv files involving storms from 2010-2015 and combining them into one csv file. After this was accomplished, we looked at the serial number of the storm, the number of times the storm occured, as well as the season, basin and sub-basin of theses storms' locations. This allowed us to visualize the trajectories of storms around the world during this time frame.
