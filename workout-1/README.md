# Workout 1


The purpose of this project was to analysis and visualize various storm patterns from 2010-2015. To accomplish this I needed to gather csv files involving storms from 2010-2015 and combining them into one csv file. After this was accomplished, I looked at the serial number of the storm, the number of times the storm occured, as well as the season, basin and sub-basin of theses storms' locations. This allowed us to visualize the trajectories of storms around the world during this time frame.
