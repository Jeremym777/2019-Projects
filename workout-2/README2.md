The purpose of this workout was to visualize different investment modalities over the course of 50 years. To start we would invest a certain amount of money into one of three different investment plans. In the high_yield we can see that there is an overall steady amount of increase that would remain stable for 50 years. In the us_stocks we can see that there is alot of uncertainties as there can an unpredictable increase or decrease in the cash amount. Lastly, in the us_bondswe see that there is a more likely chance that we will be able to make the most out of money as this investment plan has a highier chance to increase our intial investment over time compared to the other investment plans
