The purpose of this assignment was to exrtact information of two nobel laureates of the same field of study. In the process of doing webscaping, we were able to extract large amounts data from websites such as "google scholar" and saving this information within our computers as a local file. This was later used to create a data frame where it was saved into a csv file. We later explored the data frames that were created to search for articles that began with vowels, articles that began with a certain letter or even removing words and punctuations within articles themselves,which was done through practicing with the package, stringr. Lastly, we gathered them most commonly used words and cited articles and placed them into a word cloud and some form of visualization respectively.
