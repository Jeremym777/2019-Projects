# Workout 3

The purpose of this project was to exrtact information of two nobel laureates of the same field of study. In the process of doing webscaping, I was able to extract large amounts data from a website such as "google scholar" and was able to save this information within my computers as a local file. This was later used to create a data frame where it was later saved into a csv file. I  later explored the data frames that were created to search for articles that began with vowels, articles that began with a certain letter or even removing words and punctuations within articles themselves,which was done through practicing with the package, stringr. Lastly, I gathered the most commonly used words and cited articles and placed them into a word cloud and some form of visualization respectively.
